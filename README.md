What I learned
I just started learning HTML & CSS intensively 3weeks ago an I've learnt a lot in thi this challenge. I learnt how to adjust my code so that it can be responsive when viewed with devices of different screen widths. I've also learnt how to use the ::after property and a lot more. This has been really challenging and exciting to build.

i just learnt a new code snippets:

@media (min-width: 700px) {
    .entire-page {
        display: flex;
        width: 650px;
        margin: 50px auto;
        box-sizing: border-box;
        background-color: white;
    }

Continued development
In future projects, I will like to continue learning how to make my site responsive and compatible in any device. I will also like to continue learning more on displays and all the ::properties.

Useful resources
Resource 1 - I learnt how to optimize my site for all devices by studying the code written by this web designer.
